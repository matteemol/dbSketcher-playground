# Simple dbSketcher playground
This UI takes a plantUML code and generates an encoded link to see the code in action.

The [original repo of the PlantUML JS project is here](https://github.com/plantuml/plantuml-core/).

## How it works?

  * First you have to obtain the plantUML code with dbSketcher (if not, why bothering with this UI if you could just  visit the main [PlantUML website](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/)?):
  * With the generated code, just paste it in the left side of the window in the UI and that's it!
